## Market Sectors
My research focuses on arts education, so it is related to the educational market, arts market, and educational video games market.

The education sector in the US includes about 205,000 institutions and schools with a total revenue of about $1.3 trillion. [Source](https://www.firstresearch.com/Industry-Research/Education-Sector.html)

The arts contribute more than $760 billion to the US economy, and the arts export about $20 billion more than import. Consumers spend $31.6 billion on admissions to performing arts events. [Source](https://www.arts.gov/news/2018/arts-contribute-more-760-billion-us-economy)

The US is the top-buying country for game-based learning. The industry revenue of the educational game market is expected to rise to over $24 billion by 2024. [Source](https://www.gamesindustry.biz/articles/2019-08-15-metaari-us-surpasses-china-as-top-buying-country-for-game-based-learning)

## Companies
I had difficulty finding companies that currently focus solely on arts education. The following companies are either in the education space, art space, or an arts-adjacent education space.

### Babbel
Babbel is a language learning website where users participate in diverse interactive multimedia lessons and community features. Babbel is unique in its combination of language instruction and online social networking. Users can team up with partners all over the world to teach each other their native languages, upload images for use in the lessons, message others, and generate personal vocabulary sets. Babbel has an estimated $111.5 million in estimated revenue annually.

### Memrise
Memrise is a language learning platform that brings together the most powerful ideas from the science and practice of learning with game dynamics to help people learn in the quickest and most enjoyable way possible. Memrise has $5 million in estimated revenue annually.

### Artsy
Artsy’s mission is to make all the world’s art accessible to anyone with an Internet connection. Artsy is a resource for art collecting and education and features the world’s leading galleries, museum collections, foundations, artist estates, art fairs, and benefit auctions. Their database of 250,000 images of art, architecture, and design by 40,000 artists spans historical, modern, and contemporary works, and includes the largest online database of contemporary art. Artsy’s estimated annual revenue is $3.6 million.

### Acceptd
Acceptd is the largest performing and visual arts network in the world. Acceptd’s focus is on serving the arts community by connecting artists with new opportunities to further their education, career, and craft. Artists can create profiles to be discovered by colleges and universities, festivals, scholarships, and competitions. Acceptd has $4.6 million in estimated revenue annually.

### CourseHorse
CourseHorse provides an online marketplace to find, compare, and enroll in local classes, including cooking, fitness, music, art, and language courses. CourseHorse has an estimated annual revenue of $4.4 million.

## Products
The products I found either tackle one foundational skill in arts education (perspective, color mixing, observational drawing) or simulate the creative process. These products could be improved by exploring different skills that can be taught or by making it less obvious to players that the games are for educational purposes.

### Let's Create! Pottery
This app is more of a simulation. Let’s Create! Pottery offers a 3D sculpting experience in which players can mold clay in different formations, create color palettes, and fire up a kiln to complete a pottery project.

### Polysphere
Polysphere is a puzzle game that involves rotating a set of geometric shapes that form a complete picture in the right perspective.

### Mix Colors!
This app is a simple game where players try to mix different amounts of two colors to match the target pantone color.

### Perfect Paint
Perfect Paint is a game where players compete to copy a drawing as accurately as possible. Players are given the exact colors needed to complete the drawing and have a limited amount of time.

### Paint Online
Paint Online is a drawing application meant for kids. They can select between a number of tools (paintbrushes, markers, crayons), as well as different colors, to freely draw.
