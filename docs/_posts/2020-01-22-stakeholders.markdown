The primary audience of my research will be art educators and students. This could be anywhere from the primary school level to the university level. Art educators are responsible for teaching multiple students history & theory, physical skills, and communication. Art educators value creativity and different ways to engage students. But since art is subjective and everyone learns differently, it can be challenging to create a curriculum. They can also be restricted by the technology they have in their classrooms. Higher levels of education tend to have more resources available. Outside the classroom setting, many artists are also self-taught. It can be challenging for these people to learn without teachers, peer-to-peer interaction, and with limited resources.
