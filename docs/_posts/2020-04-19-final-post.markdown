Check out the game at [projectfresco.com/play]({{site.baseurl}}{% link play.markdown%})!

I reached out to new stakeholders, and a middle school visual arts teacher got back to me for an interview. She teaches 6th, 7th, and 8th grade. After demonstrating the game, she commented that the appropriate audience would likely be middle school or high school -- the puzzles could be too challenging for an elementary student. Middle schoolers tend to have some familiarity of the elements but not working comprehensive knowledge, so she noted that 6th grade might be a good group to target. Her middle schoolers would be very comfortable with playing this game, especially now that all instruction is currently online. However, this seems like it would be something supplemental, rather than replacing an actual lesson, which is what I intended it to be.

In terms of the gameplay itself, this teacher thought that the puzzles were thoughtful and thorough. She thought that I hit the most important concepts, and she particularly liked the texture puzzle. If there was one thing that could be improved, it would be the color puzzle. She said that it could be more substantial than just matching. For example, there could be a group of objects that all belong to a group (warm, cool, primary, secondary, etc), and the goal is to choose the odd one out. That way, players would be learning about color in relation to other colors, which would be more useful for art instruction.
