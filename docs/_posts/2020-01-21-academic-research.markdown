After reading the abstracts, the following papers seemed to be the most useful to me. I chose these articles because they either provided more background on arts education and the current use of video games in classrooms or went into detail about what worked and what didn't work for specific educational art games.

### Summary
Over the last 40 years, most art education games have tested students on their knowledge of art history vocabulary and art works, which doesn’t offer students a way to truly engage with the games. A critical part of art is communication, and a more effective way to learn would be to play games that have a narrative or explore complex themes and emotions. After guided discussion and reflection upon playing the game, students can switch to visual production and create a creative work based on the game.

### Summary
The aspects of video games that are most relevant for art educators are: perspective, interactivity, interface, narrative, and time & movement. Video games often switch between perspectives, first- or third-person, which is an interesting difference from historical art. Video games also allow players to create or destroy as they choose and engage with an object or space to gain understanding, and this is not unlike the making, viewing, and critiquing of art. Games have the potential to tell a story, and some of them even address social, cultural, and political issues. Lastly, video games build from the elements of time and movement presented in film, which can also be useful to study in art classrooms.

### Summary
This article discusses how art education has changed throughout history to incorporate games. For much of history, games were a medium to teach art historical content rather than a medium for expression. The article describes art as “finite play,” because students most often stay within boundaries of what they are trained in. The goal is to shift art education into “infinite play” using games to promote continual investigation and to inspire new ways to think about art content.

### Summary
Children of different ages were observed playing Minecraft, and this produced ideas about how games can be used in art education. Gaming as a learning tool works with art education because of the aesthetic choices made during gameplay. Students learn about technology, teamwork, building, and design by playing Minecraft. In Minecraft, students have a virtual space to create, collaborate, and reflect, which are some of the most valuable traits in the art classroom.

## Art Thief: An Educational Computer Game Model for Art Historical Instruction

### Summary
Students don’t retain information well from a lecture-based curriculum. This article talks about “Art Thief,” a mystery-themed puzzle video game developed by graduate researchers to engage students in more active learning for art history. In “Art Thief,” players control an art museum security guard who must steal a work of art after being held at gunpoint by a black market art dealer. While navigating through the museum, players talk to characters who give them information about the works in the galleries. The game still requires development before it can be added to a course curriculum though. There is little replay value, and the game lacks breadth and quality of art-historical content. This analysis has key takeaways about what worked and what didn’t work for one team who developed an educational art game.
